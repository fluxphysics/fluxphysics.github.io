          <p>Exoplanets are planets that exist <strong>outside of our solar system</strong>. We find them trillions of kilometers away, orbiting distant stars in solar systems of their own. The closest exoplanet to earth, Proxima Centauri b, is so far away that it takes light reflected by the planet over <strong>four years</strong> to reach us here on Earth...</p>
          <p>Although they're a long way away, exoplanets are the key to answering the question about whether we're alone in the universe. Thanks to the work of <strong>astrophysicists</strong>, we've developed techniques to help us detect, analyse, and understand the characteristics of thousands of exoplanets in the Milky Way. We'll take a look below at how astrophysicists manage to study these extraordinary planets.</p>
          <p>To truly appreciate exoplanets, first we need a quick reminder of two things: <strong>how the universe is arranged</strong>, and <strong>the scale we're dealing with</strong> when we talk about the universe.<p>

      <h2>How the universe is arranged</h2>
      <hr class="heading-underline" />

      <p>Imagine staring up into space on a very clear night. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_natural_objects_in_the_sky">brightest things</a> we can see in our night sky are the objects closest to us: the Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Mercury. All of these objects are <strong>within our solar system</strong>.</p>
    	<p>Venus is the first body we see in the night sky, visible to the west, shortly before sunset. It's so bright because (other than our moon) it's the closest other thing in the universe to us.</p>
    	<p>On a clear night with no moon, the night sky is a carpet of millions of stars. Over 99.99% of everything you can see with the naked eye is located <strong>within our galaxy</strong>, the Milky Way. Our solar system is about halfway towards the edge of the galaxy, which means that if we look towards the centre of the galaxy, we get treated to incredible sights like this:</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="/img/exoplanets/milkywayfromearth.jpg" alt="The Galactic Centre, as viewed from earth" />
        <figcaption>Fig.3 &mdash; The Galactic Centre of the Milky Way, as viewed from earth. Photo credit: <a href="https://500px.com/photo/93225141/Clever-Photo-Title-by-Jesse-Summers?ctx_page=1&from=user&user_id=868263">Jesse Summers</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The Milky Way is made up billions of other solar systems, with a star at the centre, and planets orbiting that star (our solar system is orbiting a star, too, we just call our star 'the Sun'). We call those planets exoplanets, the name for any planet located outside of <em>our</em> solar system.</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
        	<p>Let's zoom out a bit further. Our galaxy is one of billions and billions of other galaxies, spread out across <strong>the universe</strong>. Even the closest galaxies to us are incredibly far away; The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is thought to be our closest neighbouring galaxy, but light from there still takes approximately 25,000 years to reach us. On a very clear night it is possible to see some larger galaxies with the naked eye, for example the Andromeda Galaxy, approximately 2.5 million light years away.</p>

          <p>The Milky Way and Andromeda are actually moving towards each other, and eventually <a href="https://medium.com/futuresin/when-andromeda-and-the-milky-way-collide-96ece1eefb45">the two galaxies will collide</a>. But don't worry, this won't happen for around 4 Billion years.</p>

          <p>The universe contains everything that exists, and is constantly expanding into infinity in every direction. If you find that hard to comprehend, don't worry! The size of our solar system is so large that it's hard to imagine, let alone the entire universe. We'll tackle the enormous scale in the next section.</p>

            <figcaption>Fig.4 &mdash; While it’s currently only a white smudge to our eyes, Andromeda will continue to grow and grow in size as it approaches, eventually filling half the night sky after 3.75 billion years. It’ll then crash right into our Milky Way 4 billion years from now, filling the dark space around the galaxies with tendrils of light and gas — known as tidal tails — and bursting into a colorful light show visible from here on Earth. <a href="https://medium.com/futuresin/when-andromeda-and-the-milky-way-collide-96ece1eefb45">Simulation by NASA via Ella Alderson</a>.</figcaption>

          <p>Because of the distances involved, it can be extremely difficult to produce accurate scale models of our solar system. One scale model of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Solar_System">Solar System in Sweden</a> stretches the length of most of the country. In the UK, there's a smaller, walking-sized scale model called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_Space_Walk">Somerset Space Walk</a>, but it's still 11km long!</p>

      <p>The distances in space are so large that astrophysicists don't use the normal units of distance that we use to measure things on earth.</p>

      <p>More on units of space...</p>

      <p>Remember, so far we've only discussed the size of our solar system. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, contains billions of other galaxies, the closest of which is still 70,000 light years away... This next model attempts to compare the sizes of deep space objects, without taking into account the distances between.  </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Rerrange these from smallest to biggest: [galaxy, solar system, moon, universe, star, planet]</li>
        <li>Because the scale is so big, astrophysicists use different units of distance to those that we use on earth. Give a definition of the following units: [Astronomical Unit, Light Year, Parsec]</li>
        <li>What do we mean when we say that a planet is 'tidally locked' to its star?</li>
        <li>Why have we discovered so many more exoplanets via wobble than via transit?</li>
        <li>Prof X talks about earth-like exoplanets that are a similar size to the earth, but many times more massive. Massive means more mass. How can that be?</li>
