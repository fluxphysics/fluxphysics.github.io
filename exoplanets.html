    <p>Exoplanets! Wow, gee whizz, neato!</p>
    <p>Exoplanets are planets that exist <strong>outside of our solar system</strong>.</p>
    <p>That's pretty neat.</p>
    <p>When you think about it, it's pretty remarkable that we even know that exoplanets exist. The science behind the discovery and exploration of exoplanets is some of the most advanced physics we have.</p>
    <p>To truly appreciate exoplanets, first we need a quick reminder of two things: <strong>how the universe is arranged</strong>, and <strong>the scale we're dealing with</strong> when we talk about the universe.<p>

    <h2>How the universe is arranged</h2>
    <p>Start on Earth, looking up into the night sky.</p>
  	<p>The first celestial body we see is Venus, in the west, shortly after sunset. It's so bright because (other than our moon) it's the closest other thing in the universe to us.</p>
  	<p>The very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_natural_objects_in_the_sky">brightest things</a> we see in our sky are <strong>within our solar system</strong> – the sun at the centre, the moon, the other planets.</p>
  	<p>The darker the night, the more stars we can see.</p>
  	<p>Show that from different parts of the planet we see different things in the sky (Hokupa'a in the northern hemisphere, Southern Cross in the southern hemisphere, etc.)</p>
  	<p>But everything we see is the Milky Way – our galaxy. Our solar system is about halfway towards the edge of the galaxy, so looking into space from earth in one direction (within the plane of the galaxy) we see the periphery of the galaxy. In the opposite direction we can see towards the centre of the galaxy, which on a very clear night, looks a little something like this:</p>

  	<p>Let's zoom out a bit further. Our galaxy is one of billions and billions of other galaxies, spread out across the universe. Ever expanding into infinity in every direction. The mind boggles! Get a sense of the scale:</p>

  	<p>For now, let's zoom back in a bit, back in to the Milky Way, our galaxy. The Milky Way is made up billions of other solar systems, with a star at the centre, and planets orbiting that star (we call our star 'the sun).</p>
  	<p>We call those planets <strong>exoplanets</strong>, the name for any planet located outside of our solar system.</p>
