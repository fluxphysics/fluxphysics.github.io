          <p>Exoplanets are planets that exist <strong>outside of our solar system</strong>. We find them trillions of kilometers away, orbiting distant stars in solar systems of their own. The closest exoplanet to earth, Proxima Centauri b, is so far away that it takes light reflected by the planet over <strong>four years</strong> to reach us here on Earth...</p>
          <p>Although they're a long way away, exoplanets are the key to answering the question about whether we're alone in the universe. Thanks to the work of <strong>astrophysicists</strong>, we've developed techniques to help us detect, analyse, and understand the characteristics of thousands of exoplanets in the Milky Way. We'll take a look below at how astrophysicists manage to study these extraordinary planets.</p>
          <p>To truly appreciate exoplanets, first we need a quick reminder of two things: <strong>how the universe is arranged</strong>, and <strong>the scale we're dealing with</strong> when we talk about the universe.<p>

      <h2>How the universe is arranged</h2>
      <hr class="heading-underline" />

      <h3>Our Solar System</h3>
      <p>Imagine staring up into space on a very clear night. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_natural_objects_in_the_sky">brightest things</a> we can see in our night sky are the objects closest to us: the Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Mercury. All of these objects are <strong>within our solar system</strong>.</p>
    	<p>Venus is the first body we see in the night sky, visible to the west, shortly before sunset. It's so bright because (other than our moon) it's the closest other thing in the universe to us.</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          	<p>On a clear night with no moon, the night sky is a carpet of millions of stars. Over 99.99% of everything you can see with the naked eye is located <strong>within our galaxy</strong>, the Milky Way. Our solar system is about halfway towards the edge of the galaxy, which means that if we look towards the centre of the galaxy, we get treated to incredible sights some incredible sights in the night sky.</p>

            <h3>Our Galaxy</h3>
            <p>The Milky Way is made up billions of other solar systems, with a star at the centre, and planets orbiting that star (our solar system is orbiting a star, too, we just call our star 'the Sun'). We call those planets exoplanets, the name for any planet located outside of <em>our</em> solar system.</p>
            <p>Let's zoom out a bit further. Our galaxy is one of billions and billions of other galaxies, spread out across <strong>the universe</strong>. Even the closest galaxies to us are incredibly far away; The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is thought to be our closest neighbouring galaxy, but light from there still takes approximately 25,000 years to reach us. On a very clear night it is possible to see some larger galaxies with the naked eye, for example the Andromeda Galaxy, approximately 2.5 million light years away.</p>

          <h3>The Universe</h3>
          <p>The universe contains everything that exists, and is constantly expanding into infinity in every direction. If you find that hard to comprehend, don't worry! The size of our solar system is so large that it's hard to imagine, let alone the entire universe. We'll tackle the enormous scale in the next section.</p>

          <p>Because of the enormous distances involved, it can be extremely difficult to produce accurate scale models of our solar system. One scale model of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Solar_System">Solar System in Sweden</a> stretches the length of most of the country. In the UK, there's a smaller, walking-sized scale model called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_Space_Walk">Somerset Space Walk</a>, which is still 11km long!</p>

      <p>The distances in space are so large that astrophysicists don't use the normal units of distance that we use to measure things on earth.</p>

      <p>More on units of space...</p>

      <p>This model allows you to scroll to the end of our solar system. Both size and distances are set to scale – with the moon being the base for the model, at only one pixel. That's about the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence. Notice just how long it takes to get from the Sun to the Earth!</p>
      <p>Now that you know a little bit more about the units of space, try changing the units that appear above the scale along the bottom of the model. When discussing our solar system, Astronomical Units (AU) is a good choice. </p>

      <h3>Beyond our solar system</h3>
      <p>So far we've only discussed the size of our solar system – which is still big enough to give us a headache trying to comprehend it! Our galaxy, the Milky Way, contains billions of other solar systems. Remember from earlier, the closest solar system to us is the Proxima Centauri solar system, four light years away.</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>Beyond our galaxy, the scale starts to increase dramatically. We mentioned before that the closest galaxy to us is The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, 25,000 light years away. That's 1.5 billion Astronomical Units!</p>
          <p>This next model attempts to compare the sizes of deep space objects, ranging from an astronaut, to an asteroid, to a galaxy, and eventually beyond groups of galaxies, to the entire observable universe.</p>
          <p>Ok! Now you've learned all about how the universe is arranged, and the enormous distances involved in the field of atrophysics.</p>
          <p>It's time to find some exoplanets!</p>

      <h3>The radial velocity technique</h3>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>The radial velocity technique is also known as the 'Doppler wobble' technique. In this method, the explanet itself is not directly detected. Instead, the technique relies on the effects of gravity – just as the star is exerting a gravitational force on the planet, the planet is also exerting a gravitational force on the star (remember Newton's third law!). This causes the star to 'wobble' slightly as it spins, and using very sensitive telescopes we can observe the slight wobble of the star.</p>
          <p>This was the first technique used to detect an exoplanet.</p>

      <h3>The transit method</h3>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>The transit method is a much simpler concept than the radial velocity technique. The method works by looking for regular dips in the brightness of a star as a large planet passes, or transits, in front of it. For close-orbiting giant planets, this dip in brightness can be as much as 2% of the original brightness, and occurs every few days.</p>
          <p>The transit method has detected by far the highest number of exoplanets. By scanning large areas of the sky containing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of stars at once, transit surveys can find more extrasolar planets than the radial velocity method.</p>
          <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> copied from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets#Technique,_advantages,_and_disadvantages">Wikipedia</a></p>
          <p>The transit method has two major disadvantages. First, planetary transits are observable only when the planet's orbit happens to be perfectly aligned from the astronomers' vantage point. The probability of a planetary orbital plane being directly on the line-of-sight to a star is the ratio of the diameter of the star to the diameter of the orbit (in small stars, the radius of the planet is also an important factor). About 10% of planets with small orbits have such an alignment, and the fraction decreases for planets with larger orbits. For a planet orbiting a Sun-sized star at 1 AU, the probability of a random alignment producing a transit is 0.47%. Therefore, the method cannot guarantee that any particular star is <em>not</em> a host to planets.</p>
          <p>The second disadvantage of this method is a high rate of false detections. A 2012 study found that the rate of false positives for transits observed by the Kepler mission could be as high as 40% in single-planet systems. For this reason, a star with a single transit detection requires additional confirmation, typically from the radial-velocity method. The radial velocity method is especially necessary for Jupiter-sized or larger planets, as objects of that size encompass not only planets, but also brown dwarfs and even small stars.</p>

        <li>Because the scale is so big, astrophysicists use different units of distance to those that we use on earth. Give a definition of the following units: [Astronomical Unit, Light Year, Parsec]</li>
        <li>What do we mean when we say that a planet is 'tidally locked' to its star?</li>
        <li>Why have we discovered so many more exoplanets via wobble than via transit?</li>
        <li>Prof. David Sing talks about earth-like exoplanets that are a similar size to the earth, but many times more massive. Massive means more mass. How can that be?</li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoveries_of_exoplanets#/media/File:Exoplanets_discovery_methods_chart.png">this graph</a> to compare the number of explanets discovered by different methods over time. What trend can you spot, and what explaination can you give? It may help to look at <a href="https://web.njit.edu/~gary/320/assets/Exoplanet_Discovery_Meth.jpg">this old version</a>, too...</li>

      <p>Show that from different parts of the planet we see different things in the sky (Hokupa'a in the northern hemisphere, Southern Cross in the southern hemisphere, etc.)</p>
      <p>For now, let's zoom back in a bit, back in to the Milky Way, our galaxy. The Milky Way is made up billions of other solar systems, with a star at the centre, and planets orbiting that star (we call our star 'the sun).</p>
    	<p>We call those planets <strong>exoplanets</strong>, the name for any planet located outside of our solar system.</p>
