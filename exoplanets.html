          <p>Exoplanets are planets that exist <strong>outside of our solar system</strong>. We find them trillions of kilometers away, orbiting distant stars in solar systems of their own. The closest exoplanet to earth, Proxima Centauri b, is so far away that light emitted from the star it orbits takes over <strong>four years</strong> to travel through space and reach us here on Earth.</p>
          <p>Although they're a long way away, <strong>astrophysicists</strong> have developed techniques to help us detect, analyse, and understand the characteristics of thousands of exoplanets in the Milky Way. We can even predict the weather on some of them!</p>
          <p>Exoplanets are the key to answering many big questions about the universe, including the question of whether or not the lifeforms on Earth are alone in the universe... We'll take a look below at how astrophysicists manage to study these extraordinary planets.</p>
          <p>To truly appreciate exoplanets, first we need a quick reminder of two things: <strong>how the universe is arranged</strong>, and <strong>the scale we're dealing with</strong> when we talk about the universe.<p>

      <h2>How the universe is arranged</h2>
      <hr class="heading-underline" />

      <h3>Our Solar System</h3>
      <p>Imagine staring up into space on a very clear night. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_natural_objects_in_the_sky">brightest things</a> we can see in our night sky are the objects closest to us: the Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Mercury. All of these objects are <strong>within our solar system</strong>.</p>
    	<p>Venus is the first body we see in the night sky, visible to the west, shortly before sunset. It's so bright because (other than our moon) it's the closest thing in the universe to us.</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          	<p>On a clear night with no moon, the night sky is a carpet of millions of stars. Over 99.99% of everything you can see with the naked eye is located <strong>within our galaxy</strong>, the Milky Way. Our solar system is about halfway towards the edge of the galaxy, which means that when we look towards the centre of the galaxy we are treated to some incredible sights in the night sky.</p>

            <h3>Our Galaxy</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way">The Milky Way</a> is made up billions of other solar systems, each with a star at the centre, and planets orbiting that star (our solar system is orbiting a star, too, we just call our star 'the Sun'). We call those planets exoplanets, the name for any planet located outside of our solar system.</p>
            <p>The Milky Way is a type of galaxy known as a spiral galaxy. It contains around 100-400 billion stars, and at least that many exoplanets. The galaxy is so wide that it takes light 200,000 years to move from one side to the other. Much like the planets in our solar system orbit the sun, every star in the Milky Way is orbiting the 'galactic centre', a supermassive black hole known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*">Sagittarius A*</a> (pronounced Sagittarius A star). </p>

            <h3>The Universe</h3>
            <p>Let's zoom out a bit further. Our galaxy is one of billions and billions of other galaxies, spread out across <strong>the universe</strong>. Even the closest galaxies to us are incredibly far away; The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is thought to be our closest neighbouring galaxy, but light from there still takes approximately 25,000 years to reach us. On a very clear night it is possible to see some larger galaxies with the naked eye, for example the Andromeda Galaxy, approximately 2.5 million light years away.</p>

        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>When we talk about the universe, the distances involved are enormous compared with anything humans normally deal with. The moon, the closest object to us in space, is approximately 380,000km away. When we talk about the solar system, those numbers very quickly become millions and billions of kilometers. When we talk about the galaxy, we have to use trillions and beyond.</p>
          <p>Because of the enormous distances involved, it can be extremely difficult to produce accurate scale models of our solar system. One scale model of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Solar_System">Solar System in Sweden</a> shrinks everything in the solar system by 20 million times, and stretches the length of most of the country. In the UK, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_Space_Walk">Somerset Space Walk</a> is a smaller, walking-sized scale model. It shrinks everything by 530 million times, but the model is still 11km long!</p>
          <p>Remember, these examples only deal with our solar system. The distances to other objects in the Milky Way, for example, exoplanets, are many orders of magnitude larger. But the solar system is a good place to start!</p>

      <p>The distances in space are so large that astrophysicists don't use the normal units of distance that we use to measure things on earth.</p>

      <p>The three common units used in astrophysics are the <strong>astronomical unit</strong> (AU), the <strong>light year</strong> (ly) and the <strong>parsec</strong> (pc).</p>



      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <dl>
            <dt>Astronomical unit</dt>
            <dd>
              The astronomical unit is approximately the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This is a useful unit when talking about the solar system, as it gives us an approximation of distances as a ratio. For example, Jupiter orbits the distance at approximately 5.2 AU, which tells us that it is approximately 5 times further away from the Sun than the Earth is. It's also useful for comparing the distances at which exoplanets orbit their stars. <br />
              1 AU = ~150 million km
            </dd>
            <dt>Light year</dt>
            <dd>
              The light year is the distance that light travels in one year. Don't be confused by the fact that the unit contains the word 'year'; the light year is a unit of distance, not time. The light year is useful when discussing distances to other stars and other galaxies.<br />
              1 ly = 63,241 AU = ~9.5 trillion km
            </dd>
            <dt>Parsec</dt>
            <dd>
              The parsec is the most commonly used unit in professional astrophysics. It is used to measure distances between stars and galaxies. The parsec has a complicated definition: it is defined as the distance at which 1 AU subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond (1 arcsecond = 1/3600th of a degree). For now, all you need to know is that 1 pc = 3.26 ly.

That's about the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence. Notice just how long it takes to get from the Sun to the Earth!</p>

      <h3>Beyond our solar system</h3>
      <p>The models we've looked at so far have only discussed the size of our solar system, just one of the billions of solar systems that make up the Milky Way. Now that we've covered the units used in astrophysics, we can start to look further afield. We mentioned earlier that the closest solar system to us is the Proxima Centauri solar system, four light years away. That's still tiny compared with the distances between galaxies!</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>Beyond our galaxy, the scale starts to increase dramatically. We mentioned before that the closest galaxy to us is The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, 25,000 light years away. That's 1.5 billion astronomical units!</p>
          <p>This next model attempts to compare the sizes of deep space objects, ranging from an astronaut, to an asteroid, to a galaxy, and eventually beyond groups of galaxies, to the entire observable universe.</p>
          <p>Ok! Now you've learned all about how the universe is arranged, and the enormous distances involved in the field of atrophysics.</p>
          <p>It's time to find some exoplanets!</p>

        	<p>An exoplanet is a planet that orbits any star other than the Sun – and over 4,000 of them have now been discovered. Scientists nowadays are not only able to find these amazing planetary systems, but can even use space telescopes to start to understand the weather on these alien worlds<span class="footnote-ref">[1]</span>! This next video features two astrophysics from the University of Exeter, who explain what exoplanets are in more detail, the different types of exoplanet, and where we find them.</p>
          <p>Only three different types of planet occur in our solar system: rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars), gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). In contrast, there are <a href="https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/notable-exoplanets.html">many different types</a> of exoplanet, most of which don't occur within our solar system. Some examples include: Hot Jupiters which are similar to Jupiter, but orbit very close to their star, so they're extremely hot; 'cotton candy planets', which have extremely low densities; or Super Earths, which are rocky planets similar to Earth, but larger and much denser.</p>

      <h2>Detecting Exoplanets</h2>
      <hr class="heading-underline" />
      <p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoveries_of_exoplanets">many methods</a> by which we can detect exoplanets.</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>Each method involves using telescopes, either based here on Earth in observatories, or in space, orbiting Earth. The most famous satellite telescope is the Hubble Space Telescope, which went into orbit in 1990 and is still operational today. In 2006 the Hubble Space Telescope was used to survey stars, searching for exoplanets, in a project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_Window_Eclipsing_Extrasolar_Planet_Search#Planets_discovered">SWEEPS</a>. SWEEPS discovered 16 candidate planets, which sounds like a lot, but more recently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanets_discovered_using_the_Kepler_space_telescope">Kepler Space Telescope</a> discovered around 2300 new exoplanets between 2009 and 2015.</p>
          <p>Part of the reason for the Kepler mission's success was that scientists managed to invent new methods of detecting exoplanets while the telescope was in orbit. This is because exoplanet detection relies on the analysis of data recorded by sensors within the telescope, not on images captured. In fact, it's extremly rare to directly view an exoplanet, with only around 1% of exoplanets being discovered this way. Discovering exoplanets via direct imaging is difficult because exoplanets are extremely faint light sources compared to stars, and what little light comes from them tends to be lost in the glare from their parent star<span class="footnote-ref">[2]</span>.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look in more detail at the two most common methods used to detect exoplanets.</p>

      <h3>The radial velocity technique</h3>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>The radial velocity technique is also known as the 'Doppler wobble' technique. In this method, the explanet itself is not directly detected. Instead, the technique relies on the effects of gravity – just as the star is exerting a gravitational force on the planet, the planet is also exerting a gravitational force on the star (remember Newton's third law!). This causes the star to 'wobble' slightly as it spins, and using very sensitive telescopes we can observe the slight wobble of the star.</p>
          <p>This was the first technique used to detect an exoplanet.</p>
          <p>In fact, rather than just wobbling, the star and the planet form a system, and are both orbiting around the centre of mass of the system, known as the barycenter. Because the star is many times more massive than the planet, the barycenter is very close to the centre of gravity in the system. As such, the star only moves slightly, and appears to wobble, while the planet orbits much further away from the centre of mass. </p>
          <p>In this simple animation, there is only one planet affecting the system, but in practice, most stars will be orbited by more than one planet. Each of these planets will exert a force on the star proportional to its mass, and this affects the way the star wobbles. In practice this means that the wobble is slightly reduced, making it extremely difficult to detect, and requiring highly sensitive telescopes to make these observations.</p>

      <h3>The transit method</h3>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>The transit method is a much simpler concept than the radial velocity technique. The method works by looking for regular dips in the brightness of a star as a large planet passes, or transits, in front of it. For close-orbiting giant planets, this dip in brightness can be as much as 2% of the original brightness, and occurs every few days.</p>
          <p>The transit method has detected by far the highest number of exoplanets. By scanning large areas of the sky containing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of stars at once, transit surveys can find more extrasolar planets than the radial velocity method.</p>
          <p>The transit method has two major disadvantages. First, planetary transits are observable only when the planet's orbit happens to be perfectly aligned from the astronomers' vantage point. The probability of a planetary orbital plane being directly on the line-of-sight to a star is the ratio of the diameter of the star to the diameter of the orbit (in small stars, the radius of the planet is also an important factor). About 10% of planets with small orbits have such an alignment, and the fraction decreases for planets with larger orbits. For a planet orbiting a Sun-sized star at 1 AU, the probability of a random alignment producing a transit is 0.47%. Therefore, the method cannot guarantee that any particular star is <em>not</em> a host to planets.<span class="footnote-ref">[3]</span></p>
          <p>The second disadvantage of this method is a high rate of false detections. A 2012 study found that the rate of false positives for transits observed by the Kepler mission could be as high as 40% in single-planet systems. For this reason, a star with a single transit detection requires additional confirmation, typically from the radial-velocity method. The radial velocity method is especially necessary for Jupiter-sized or larger planets, as objects of that size encompass not only planets, but also brown dwarfs and even small stars.<span class="footnote-ref">[3]</span></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Because the scale is so big, astrophysicists use different units of distance to those that we use on earth. Give a definition of the following units: [Astronomical Unit, Light Year, Parsec]</li>
        <li>What do we mean when we say that a planet is 'tidally locked' to its star?</li>
        <li>Why have we discovered so many more exoplanets via wobble than via transit?</li>
        <li>Prof. David Sing talks about earth-like exoplanets that are a similar size to the earth, but many times more massive. Massive means more mass. How can that be?</li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoveries_of_exoplanets#/media/File:Exoplanets_discovery_methods_chart.png">this graph</a> to compare the number of explanets discovered by different methods over time.
