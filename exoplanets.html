          <p>Exoplanets are planets that exist <strong>outside of our solar system</strong>. We find them trillions of kilometers away, orbiting distant stars in solar systems of their own. The closest exoplanet to earth, Proxima Centauri b, is so far away that light emitted from the star it orbits takes over <strong>four years</strong> to travel through space and reach us here on Earth.</p>
          <p>Although they're a long way away, <strong>astrophysicists</strong> have developed techniques to help us detect, analyse, and understand the characteristics of thousands of exoplanets in the Milky Way. We can even predict the weather on some of them!</p>
          <p>Exoplanets are the key to answering many big questions about the universe, including the question of whether or not the lifeforms on Earth are alone in the universe... We'll take a look below at how astrophysicists manage to study these extraordinary planets.</p>
          <p>To truly appreciate exoplanets, first we need a quick reminder of two things: <strong>how the universe is arranged</strong>, and <strong>the scale we're dealing with</strong> when we talk about the universe.<p>

      <hr class="heading-underline" />

      <h3>Our Solar System</h3>
      <p>Imagine staring up into space on a very clear night. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_natural_objects_in_the_sky">brightest things</a> we can see in our night sky are the objects closest to us: the Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Mercury. All of these objects are <strong>within our solar system</strong>.</p>
    	<p>Venus is the first body we see in the night sky, visible to the west, shortly before sunset. It's so bright because (other than our moon) it's the closest thing in the universe to us.</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          	<p>On a clear night with no moon, the night sky is a carpet of millions of stars. Over 99.99% of everything you can see with the naked eye is located <strong>within our galaxy</strong>, the Milky Way. Our solar system is about halfway towards the edge of the galaxy, which means that when we look towards the centre of the galaxy we are treated to some incredible sights in the night sky.</p>

            <h3>Our Galaxy</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way">The Milky Way</a> is made up billions of other solar systems, each with a star at the centre, and planets orbiting that star (our solar system is orbiting a star, too, we just call our star 'the Sun'). We call those planets exoplanets, the name for any planet located outside of our solar system.</p>
            <p>The Milky Way is a type of galaxy known as a spiral galaxy. It contains around 100-400 billion stars, and at least that many exoplanets. The galaxy is so wide that it takes light 200,000 years to move from one side to the other. Much like the planets in our solar system orbit the sun, every star in the Milky Way is orbiting the 'galactic centre', a supermassive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black hole</a> known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*">Sagittarius A*</a> (pronounced Sagittarius A star). </p>

            <h3>The Universe</h3>
            <p>Let's zoom out a bit further. Our galaxy is one of billions and billions of other galaxies, spread out across <strong>the universe</strong>. Even the closest galaxies to us are incredibly far away; The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is thought to be our closest neighbouring galaxy, but light from there still takes approximately 25,000 years to reach us. On a very clear night it is possible to see some larger galaxies with the naked eye, for example the Andromeda Galaxy, approximately 2.5 million light years away.</p>

          <p>The universe contains everything that exists, and is constantly expanding into infinity in every direction. If you find that hard to comprehend, don't worry! The size of just our <em>solar system</em> is so large that it's hard to imagine, let alone the entire universe.</p>

          <p>When we talk about the universe, the distances involved are enormous compared with anything humans normally deal with. The moon, the closest object to us in space, is approximately 380,000km away. When we talk about the solar system, those numbers very quickly become millions and billions of kilometers. When we talk about the galaxy, we have to use trillions and beyond.</p>
          <p>Because of the enormous distances involved, it can be extremely difficult to produce accurate scale models of our solar system. One scale model of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Solar_System">Solar System in Sweden</a> shrinks everything in the solar system by 20 million times, and stretches the length of most of the country. In the UK, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_Space_Walk">Somerset Space Walk</a> is a smaller, walking-sized scale model. It shrinks everything by 530 million times, but the model is still 11km long!</p>
          <p>Remember, these examples only deal with our solar system. The distances to other objects in the Milky Way, for example, exoplanets, are many orders of magnitude larger. But the solar system is a good place to start!</p>

      </div>

      <p>The distances in space are so large that astrophysicists don't use the normal units of distance that we use to measure things on earth.</p>

      <p>The three common units used in astrophysics are the <strong>astronomical unit</strong> (AU), the <strong>light year</strong> (ly) and the <strong>parsec</strong> (pc).</p>



      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <dl>
            <dt>Astronomical unit</dt>
            <dd>
              The astronomical unit is approximately the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This is a useful unit when talking about the solar system, as it gives us an approximation of distances as a ratio. For example, Jupiter orbits the distance at approximately 5.2 AU, which tells us that it is approximately 5 times further away from the Sun than the Earth is. It's also useful for comparing the distances at which exoplanets orbit their stars. <br />
              1 AU = ~150 million km
            </dd>
            <dt>Light year</dt>
            <dd>
              The light year is the distance that light travels in one year. Don't be confused by the fact that the unit contains the word 'year'; the light year is a unit of distance, not time. The light year is useful when discussing distances to other stars and other galaxies.<br />
              1 ly = 63,241 AU = ~9.5 trillion km
            </dd>
            <dt>Parsec</dt>
            <dd>
              The parsec is the most commonly used unit in professional astrophysics. It is used to measure distances between stars and galaxies. The parsec has a complicated definition: it is defined as the distance at which 1 AU subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond (1 arcsecond = 1/3600th of a degree). For now, all you need to know is that 1 pc = 3.26 ly.

      <h3>Beyond our solar system</h3>
      <p>The models we've looked at so far have only discussed the size of our solar system, just one of the billions of solar systems that make up the Milky Way. Now that we've covered the units used in astrophysics, we can start to look further afield. We mentioned earlier that the closest solar system to us is the Proxima Centauri solar system, four light years away. That's still tiny compared with the distances between galaxies!</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>Beyond our galaxy, the scale starts to increase dramatically. We mentioned before that the closest galaxy to us is The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, 25,000 light years away. That's 1.5 billion astronomical units!</p>
          <p>This next model attempts to compare the sizes of deep space objects, ranging from an astronaut, to an asteroid, to a galaxy, and eventually beyond groups of galaxies, to the entire observable universe.</p>
          <p>Ok! Now you've learned all about how the universe is arranged, and the enormous distances involved in the field of atrophysics.</p>
          <p>It's time to find some exoplanets!</p>

      <h2>Detecting Exoplanets</h2>
      <hr class="heading-underline" />
      <p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoveries_of_exoplanets">many methods</a> by which we can detect exoplanets.</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>Each method involves using telescopes, either based here on Earth in observatories, or in space, orbiting Earth. The most famous satellite telescope is the Hubble Space Telescope, which went into orbit in 1990 and is still operational today. In 2006 the Hubble Space Telescope was used to survey stars, searching for exoplanets, in a project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_Window_Eclipsing_Extrasolar_Planet_Search#Planets_discovered">SWEEPS</a>. SWEEPS discovered 16 candidate planets, which sounds like a lot, but more recently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanets_discovered_using_the_Kepler_space_telescope">Kepler Space Telescope</a> discovered around 2300 new exoplanets between 2009 and 2015.</p>
          <p>Part of the reason for the Kepler mission's success was that scientists managed to invent new methods of detecting exoplanets while the telescope was in orbit. This is because exoplanet detection relies on the analysis of data recorded by sensors within the telescope, not on images captured. In fact, it's extremly rare to directly view an exoplanet, with only around 1% of exoplanets being discovered this way. Discovering exoplanets via direct imaging is difficult because exoplanets are extremely faint light sources compared to stars, and what little light comes from them tends to be lost in the glare from their parent star<span class="footnote-ref" data-footnote-link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets#Direct_imaging" data-footnote-title="Wikipedia" data-footnote-content="Direct imaging of exoplanets"></span>.</p>

      <h3>The radial velocity technique</h3>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>The radial velocity technique is also known as the 'Doppler wobble' technique. In this method, the explanet itself is not directly detected. Instead, the technique relies on the effects of gravity – just as the star is exerting a gravitational force on the planet, the planet is also exerting a gravitational force on the star (remember Newton's third law!). This causes the star to 'wobble' slightly as it spins, and using very sensitive telescopes we can observe the slight wobble of the star.</p>
          <p>This was the first technique used to detect an exoplanet.</p>
          <p>In fact, rather than just wobbling, the star and the planet form a system, and are both orbiting around the centre of mass of the system, known as the barycenter. Because the star is many times more massive than the planet, the barycenter is very close to the centre of gravity in the system. As such, the star only moves slightly, and appears to wobble, while the planet orbits much further away from the centre of mass. </p>
          <p>In this simple animation, there is only one planet affecting the system, but in practice, most stars will be orbited by more than one planet. Each of these planets will exert a force on the star proportional to its mass, and this affects the way the star wobbles. In practice this means that the wobble is slightly reduced, making it extremely difficult to detect, and requiring highly sensitive telescopes to make these observations.</p>

      <h3>The transit method</h3>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>The transit method is a much simpler concept than the radial velocity technique. The method works by looking for regular dips in the brightness of a star as a large planet passes, or transits, in front of it. For close-orbiting giant planets, this dip in brightness can be as much as 2% of the original brightness, and occurs every few days.</p>
          <p>The transit method has detected by far the highest number of exoplanets. By scanning large areas of the sky containing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of stars at once, transit surveys can find more extrasolar planets than the radial velocity method.</p>
          <p>The transit method has two major disadvantages. First, planetary transits are observable only when the planet's orbit happens to be perfectly aligned from the astronomers' vantage point. The probability of a planetary orbital plane being directly on the line-of-sight to a star is the ratio of the diameter of the star to the diameter of the orbit (in small stars, the radius of the planet is also an important factor). About 10% of planets with small orbits have such an alignment, and the fraction decreases for planets with larger orbits. For a planet orbiting a Sun-sized star at 1 AU, the probability of a random alignment producing a transit is 0.47%. Therefore, the method cannot guarantee that any particular star is <em>not</em> a host to planets.</p>
          <p>The second disadvantage of this method is a high rate of false detections. A 2012 study found that the rate of false positives for transits observed by the Kepler mission could be as high as 40% in single-planet systems. For this reason, a star with a single transit detection requires additional confirmation, typically from the radial-velocity method. The radial velocity method is especially necessary for Jupiter-sized or larger planets, as objects of that size encompass not only planets, but also brown dwarfs and even small stars.<span class="footnote-ref" data-footnote-link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets#Transit_photometry" data-footnote-title="Wikipedia" data-footnote-content="Transit photometry method of exoplanet detection"></span></p>

      <p>So, now we know how expolanets are detected &ndash; but that's only half of the story? How do we know what these exoplanets are like? How do we know their temperature, their composition, and even their weather? We'll take a look at how we explore exoplanets in the <a href="#exploringExoplanets">next section</a>.

      <h2>Exploring Exoplanets: The search for life</h2>
      <hr class="heading-underline" />

      <p>As well as attempting to detect new exoplanets, astrophysicists can understand the composition, structure, and even the weather on known exoplanets. This can be done by analysing data about the planet gathered by making observations using the different wavelengths of light, and comparing the measurements to sophisticated computer models.</p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
        	<p>Hold on a second... Didn't we say before that sometimes astrophysicists detect exoplanets without even being able to see them? If we can't even see them, how could we possibly understand the weather on exoplanets?!</p>
          <p>As Dr. Nathan Mayne explains [Figure 16], the weather on Earth is largely dictated by large scale differences in temperature. At the equator, the temperature is hotter, causing air to rise. At the poles, the temperature is much colder, causing air to sink towards the surface. This difference in temperature between the equator and the poles is called a <strong>temperature gradient</strong>, and creates a <strong>convection current</strong> as warm air rises and cool air is drawn in to replace it. This movement of air is what we commonly call <strong>wind</strong>.</p>
          <p>The same principles can be applied to exoplanets. If we know how hot a distant star is by measuring its brightness, and we know how far away its orbiting planet is, we can start to calculate the temperature on the surface of the planet. For some planets, we can also calculate the temperature differences between the equator and poles. For tidally locked planets, we can calculate the difference in temperature between the night and the day sides. In each of these cases, knowing the temperature difference helps us understand the winds on the surface of the planet, and therefore the larger scale weather patterns that make up its climate.</p>
          <p>The discipline of analysing the climate on distant exoplanets is known as <strong>exoclimatology</strong>.</p>
          <p>Of course, this concept only works for planets with an atmosphere. Some planets, such as Mercury in our solar system, have either a very thin atmosphere, or no atmosphere at all. No atmosphere means no weather!</p>

      <h3>Exoplanets: The homes of alien lifeforms?</h3>
      <p>Exoplanets hold the clues to life elsewhere in the galaxy! Watch the video in Figure 18, of Dr. Nathan Mayne explaining how he's building a framework to use exoclimatology to search distant solar systems for signs of life. The models that make up the framework help us determine the liklihood of an exoplanet hosting forms of life. Once we've established the possiblity is there, we can start attempting to detect <strong>biosignatures</strong> — evidence of past or present lifeforms. </p>

      <div class="essay-row">
        <div class="essay-col-half">
          <p>As we mentioned earlier, our our search for life elsewhere in the universe is focused on <strong>Earth-like</strong> planets in the <strong>habitable zones</strong> of distant stars.</p>
          <p>Two key features of an Earth-like exoplanets are that they might have liquid water on the surface of the planet, and an atmosphere that could support life as we know it. Of course, life on other worlds might not need the same conditions that lifeforms here on Earth require, but these constraints are a useful starting point.</p>

          <p>It’s important to distinguish 'Earth-like' from 'Earth-sized' when discussing exoplanets. Earth-like is much more important than Earth-sized &ndash; just because a planet is a smiliar size to Earth, it doesn’t mean that it could support life. Here in our solar system, Venus is a similar size to Earth, but it has no surface water, an atmosphere of almost pure carbon dioxide, and an average surface temperature of nearly 500&deg;c! These aren't the kind of conditions we'd expect life to exist in.</p>

          <p>So how do we look for Earth-like planets? The most basic condition for being able to sustain liquid water is the planet’s position in relation to its star. Scientists call the region around a star where liquid water can exist on the surface of a planet the habitable zone: not so close to the star that water all evaporates, and not so far from the star that it all freezes. This area is also known as the 'Goldilocks zone', because it's not too hot, and not too cold.</p>

          <p>We can tell if a planet is in the habitable zone based on the distance of the planet from its host star and the temperature of that star. A bigger, hotter star’s habitable zone is farther out than that of a smaller, cooler star.</p>

          <p>There could be as many as 40 billion planets in the habitable zone of stars right here in the Milky Way galaxy. So far we’ve found about 200. That may not seem like many, but consider this: it's possible we’ve already found a planet that hosts life, and we just haven't realised it yet...<span class="footnote-ref" data-footnote-link="https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/what-is-the-habitable-zone.html" data-footnote-title="The Planetary Society" data-footnote-content="What is the habitable zone?"></span></p>
